## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Used `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} blocks to communicate colour changes and movement between sprites
+ Used the `Video Sensing`{:class="block3extensions"} extension blocks to detect colours in real-world objects
+ Used the `or`{:class="block3operators"} operator to aid colour identification

If you are following the [Protect our planet](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/raspberrypi/protect-our-planet) pathway, you can move on to the [Electricity generation](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/electricity-generation) project. In this project, you will create a program to input real data on the range of natural resources used by various countries to generate electricity. Then compare the results using animnated and interactive data visualisation.

You could also create origami animals that represent the animals that you are counting. You can [find many different origami animals to create here](http://rpf.io/origami){:target="_blank"}.
