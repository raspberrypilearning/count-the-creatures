## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Used `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} blocks to communicate colour changes and movement between sprites
+ Used the `Video Sensing`{:class="block3extensions"} extension blocks to detect colours in real-world objects
+ Used the `or`{:class="block3operators"} operator to aid colour identification

If you are following the [Keep it green] pathway of projects, then try out the project [Project name].

You could also create origami animals that represent the animals that you are counting. You can [find many different origami animals to create here](http://rpf.io/origami){:target="_blank"}.
