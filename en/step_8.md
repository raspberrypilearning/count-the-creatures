## What next?

In this project, you have:

+ Used the tools in the Paint editor to create your own stress ball sprite
+ Added a sound to your stress ball that is played when clicked
+ Added graphic effects to your stress ball to squash it

If you are following the Keep it green pathway of projects, then try out the project [blah].

Another optional exercise is to create origami animals that represent the animals you are counting. You can find many different origami animals to create [here](http://rpf.io/origami).
