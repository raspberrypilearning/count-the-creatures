## Introduction

In this project you will be creating a wildlife camera, that can count the number of birds, of different colours, that pass in front of the camera's view. 

### What you will make

When the user passes a different coloured object (red, green or blue) past the centre of the screen, then the number of birds of each colour will increase.
