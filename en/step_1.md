## Introduction

Computers can be used to study wildlife in areas where it is not practical to do this.

In this project, you will create a wildlife camera that can count creatures of different colours that pass in front of it. You will use different-coloured paper or objects to represent different-coloured birds.

### What you will make

When the user shows a different-coloured piece of paper or object (red, green, or blue) past the centre of the screen, a graphic bird of that colour will appear on the Stage. The user can then count the number of graphic birds to know how many have passed the camera over time.
