## Introduction

In this project you will be creating a wild life camera, that can count the number of birds, of different colours, that pass in front of the camera's view.

### What you will make

--- no-print ---
Allow your web-browser to access your camera, and then click the green flag. If you pass different coloured, red, green or blue, objects pass the centre of the screen, the number of birds of each colour will increase.
